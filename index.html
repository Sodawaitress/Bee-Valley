        <em>
        When I was a child, I lived in a valley of my own mind.<br>
         Nobody else is actually there even though physically I have always lived in huge cities.<br>
         One day, the only people i invited into my valley left.<br>
         I couldn't bear staying in my valley alone again.<br>
         I left too, leaving my valley empty.<br>
         Then I moved into a shop, selling all kinds of my part<br>
         Just to figure out what my exact value are.<br>
         Five years later, I decided to walk out of that shop, go back to my valley.<br>
         I have the courage to live alone, and walk back to the shop again.<br>
        Welcome to my valley.<br>
        Weary, empty, hollow travellers of the universe. <br>
        May the peace be with you.<br>
